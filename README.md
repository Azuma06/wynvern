## 🐉 Zekrom!

Hi! I'm a teenager that likes to code, do you want to know more about me?
I am from Brazil, more specifically from Rio Grande do Sul, and I'm at the 9th grade

## ℹ️ What I know

Currently I'm working on my skills so I can use JavaScript better. I learned Python, Html, and Css. I really want to learn C# and more about front-end

## 💻 What I use 

I use a poor little laptop that barely runs anything, is it that bad? Yes it is but at least i can write code in it. The only pheripheral on my computer that i love is my keyboar, a Redragon Kumara Lunar white

## 📒 My projects

If you go to my repositories you will see nothing, that's because I don't want to expose my code (It's good but i get shy showing it). I have three bots for discord (one of them I'm currently working), a music player (It's my first project), and a storage Api called Twuck (it uses Flask).
