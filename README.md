Hi! I'm a teenager that likes dragons, do you want to know more about me?
I am from Brazil, more specifically from the Rio Grande do Sul, and I'm in the 1st year of high school

## about

Currently, I'm working on my skills so I can use JavaScript better. I've learned *Python*, *Html*, and *CSS*. I really want to learn *C#* and more about full-stack development

### what do I use

I was coding stuff on my old laptop from Hp, and now finally I have a decent computer... It doesn't have anything special in it

### my projects

I don't have that many projects open, but sometimes I get creative and do unusual stuff, those are always things that I've never used. I am working on a discord bot called Soft, so if you wanna help me test it some time, lets chat!
