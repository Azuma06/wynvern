## 🐉 Zekrom!

Hi! I'm a teenager that likes to code, do you want to know more about me?
I am from Brazil, more specifically from Rio Grande do Sul, and I'm at the 9th grade

## ℹ️ What I know

Currently I'm working on my skills so I can use JavaScript better. I learned Python, Html, and Css. I really want to learn C# and more about front-end

## 💻 What I use 

I use a poor little laptop that barely runs anything, is it that bad? Yes it is but at least i can write code in it. The only pheripheral on my computer that i love is my keyboar, a Redragon Kumara Lunar white

## 📒 My projects

If you go to my repositories you will see nothing, that's because I don't want to expose my code (It's good but i get shy showing it). 

### 🚚 Caminhão-bot

I have worked in three discord bots. The first one is called "caminhão", a pretty simple bot that is so bad, but soo bad that I don't even know how it works (tha's because it was one of my first projects). 

### 🚛 Truck

The second one is "Truck" (I don't have good names I'm sowwy ;-;), that one is one thousand times better and if someone used it it would work fine! 

### 🐲 Draco

And the last but not least "Draco", that one is my favorite, it is my first project using a new language, JavaScript. It works so much faster than python that my other bots look like babies near him (even if Truck and Caminhão are considered heavy semi-trucks). I'm working hard to make Draco my best bot of all time...
