# 🐉 Zekrom!

Hi! I'm a teenager that likes dragons, do you want to know more about me?
I am from Brazil, more specifically from the Rio Grande do Sul, and I'm in the 1st year of high school

### ℹ️ What do I know?

Currently, I'm working on my skills so I can use JavaScript better. I've learned *Python*, *Html*, and *CSS*. I really want to learn *C#* and more about full-stack development

### 💻 What do I use? 

I was coding stuff on my old laptop from Hp, and now finally I have a decent computer... It doesn't have anything special in it

### 📒 My projects!

If you go to my repositories you will see nothing, that's because I don't want to expose my code *(It's good but I get shy showing it)*. I have three bots for discord *(one of them I'm currently working on)*, a music player *(my first project)*, and a storage API called *Truck*
